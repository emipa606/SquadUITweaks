A few minor tweaks to the UI when selecting groups:


  - shows weapon range when the mouse is over the "Attack" button
  - shows the weapon types that are equipped -- clicking the weapon allows for assigning targets to all pawns with that weapon


All of the code is basically vanilla Rimworld, I just linked various bits up.
